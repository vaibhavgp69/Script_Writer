# Script_Writer
A machine learning algorithm that learns the script you provide and writes its own script


1) You can run the Algorithm in Colab with runtime type - GPU 

2) Choose and upload any script file you want to in the algorithm (example : Your whatsapp Text Export file ( after removing the time stamps) or BEE MOVIE SCRIPT works too)

3) In the 4th Block of code 
-------> history = model.fit(data, epochs=50, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])
-------> More the Epochs  value , better the learning (dont go above 100 or 150  , prefferd : 50 )
                                       
4) In the final block , type any small input to run the code and generate the Script
