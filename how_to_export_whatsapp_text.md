1) Go to you phone , open the chat you want to export
2) Click on the top right 3 dots , click on more , select EXPORT CHATS
3) Do not Include Media
4) Save it on your google drive or wherever you want so you can easily download it on your Desktop
5) Once you have the .txt file on your desktop , use the edit_txt.py file i have uploaded to cut the timestamps from the .txt file u just downloaded
6) You will get a new file saved , upload that file to the algorithm , thats it


extra note : ( if you have too many stickers or emojis , do find and replace them with nothing - basically erase them )

if the chats are too short , the model will find it difficult to learn ( begginer model )
